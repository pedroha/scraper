Done
0) Getting the index page and a topic page
1) Getting selectors with cheerio to get Lithuanian's word and hint
2) Gather all audio resources
	When trying to download all the audio resources:
	Many requests get: { [Error: socket hang up] code: 'ECONNRESET' }

	? --> Need to slow down the simultaneous requests (or queue up up to 6 concurrent ones or so)
	Answer: run multiple times but only make extra requests for those that failed

3) Output database in pretty json (sorted database!)

4) Compressed json version, prettier json (longer lines)
   Hacked for english translation for first row

5) Front-end HTML page

6) Playable interface, stoppable! + automatic scrollable


TODO
a) Deploy to: labas.surge.sh
b) Add control panel: play, stop (display absolute / sticky!?)
c) Clickable (and selectable to set currentItem)

d) Make it responsive (mobile friendly, mostly CSS, viewports)
e) Collect for all lanaguages in book2.de

f) Coloring theme

React version!
g) Dynamic loading (server-side + client side: isomorphic -> ReactJS!)


----

Decision

Either, create a full HTML with all the nodes as DOM in HTML
Or pass JSON to create on the fly?

Easier for having all in the page (and perhaps as a JS object?)
-> Can play right away!

For prototyping: use 3 topics to loop through

----

Issues: this will try to load all <audio> files (too many, like 1400 files!)
Load the audio source on demand!

Still slow, DOM parsing tie

<audio id="audio-1">
	<source src="audio/0002.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
</audio>

<audio id="audio-0002">
</audio>
