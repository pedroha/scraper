TODO
-----

a) Vocabulary for Lithuanian (scraping + images + audio)
b) Support (design) for mobile: audiosprites!

-----

a) Add control panel: play, stop (display absolute / sticky!?)
b) Clickable (and selectable to set currentItem)
c) Collect for all lanaguages in book2.de

d) Coloring theme

React version!?
e) Dynamic loading (server-side + client side: isomorphic -> ReactJS!)


First deployment
-> Takes too long for iterative deployment since /web/audio is uploaded *every* time
-> Need to split audio files in a different subdomain (all at once?)

http://book2.surge.sh/audio/LT/0001.mp3
http://book2.surge.sh/audio/LT/0001.mp3


Split into 3 projects?
a) Utility library to support each of these projects
b) Audio project (to retrieve all audios into multiple folders) -> upload own subdomain
c) Multi-language: Web project (to upload for each language)


We can download all the AUDIO files in one big ZIP file!

----

Decision

Either, create a full HTML with all the nodes as DOM in HTML
Or pass JSON to create on the fly?

Easier for having all in the page (and perhaps as a JS object?)
-> Can play right away!

For prototyping: use 3 topics to loop through

----

Issues: this will try to load all <audio> files (too many, like 1400 files!)
Load the audio source on demand!

Still slow, DOM parsing tie

<audio id="audio-1">
	<source src="audio/0002.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
</audio>

<audio id="audio-0002">
</audio>
