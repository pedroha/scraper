Done
0) Getting the index page and a topic page
1) Getting selectors with cheerio to get Lithuanian's word and hint
2) Gather all audio resources
	When trying to download all the audio resources:
	Many requests get: { [Error: socket hang up] code: 'ECONNRESET' }

	? --> Need to slow down the simultaneous requests (or queue up up to 6 concurrent ones or so)
	Answer: run multiple times but only make extra requests for those that failed

3) Output database in pretty json (sorted database!)


TODO
4) Translate the topic words with audio but no English
